Text: Hi, nice to meet you and thanks for taking your time to visit our blog. 

So this is us, **LVRS** and as you may have gathered we're here to help make relationships even better. We're not a counselling service or a service to find the answer to eternal happiness, however you can rely on us to make it easier to spend quality time with your partner. So if you're in a relationship that could benefit from a little injection of fun, then you're in the right place. 

We know the demands of modern life can leave us all short of time , and it's not always easy to organise something for you and your loved one as regular as you'd like to. Well, that's specifically where we can help. Wouldn't it be great to have an incredible dating experience with your partner completely organised, so all you have to do is show up? If the answer is *yes*, then give **LVRS** a try and spoil yourself and your partner with and experience you both surely deserve. 

We're just starting out so we admit we don't know you yet, but we sure as heck would like to get to know you. We're happy to talk to you anytime about our service and continually improve our offerings. So if you have any burning questions or simply want to talk to someone more about the **LVRS** service, then please do get in touch in any way you choose:
