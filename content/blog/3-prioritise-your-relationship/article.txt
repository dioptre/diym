Text: Time is a hard thing to manage for everyone. Our careers and life responsibilities take over our waking hours and often ignore the signs that there's other things in our life beckoning for our attention. We're all a little guilty of neglecting ourselves or a partner at times, however the importance of dedicated time for your relationship shouldn't be overlooked, rather on the contrary, it should be at the top of your priority list. 

A healthy relationship means happiness for both you and your partner and has been linked to mental and physical health too. Relationships require time to nurture and it is up to you to find this time so you can maintain a healthy and enjoyable relationship with a partner.

One day or night completely focused on one another will always trump seven nights of divided attention and interruptions.

So to help you find more time to dedicate to your relationship here's five tips that you can sneak into your hectic routine without putting out anything important.  

**Swap the TV for cooking together** - it's no secret that TV turns even the most intellectual of us into Zombies, and with the flood of reality shows tarnishing our TV screens it's probably making our IQ's drop a peg or two. Cooking together however stimulates conversations, can be playful and allows you to connect with your partner in a creative way. So dust off that old recipe book and choose something together that will get the tastebuds tingling.

**Try a workout together** - you know they say that couples who sweat together, stay together. Besides working out is a lot more fun with a buddy, so why not try with your partner? You can choose something that you both like and can suit both your fitness levels such as a bootcamp in your local park, a casual game of tennis or even a long walk/hike. It'll get endorphins going, allow you to engage in some pre-during-post conversation and you'll feel great at the end. Win-win.

**Go to bed early** - simple isn't it, but many of us find it seemingly impossible. We starve ourselves of sleep in order to finish that book, watch that awful movie, write that last work email but we often forget to just switch off from all those distractions and just slide into bed early to enjoy our partner's company. So plan even a single one evening a week to lay in bed early, talk with your partner, cuddle, flirt, be intimate - whatever it is commit to focus on each other, and leave the mobile out of the bedroom.

**Play a game** - what? like (link: http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-video-games-perfect-for-couples.php text: computer games) or (link: http://www.bestboardgameslist.com/best-board-games-for-couples/ text: board games)? Well yes any game is fine as long as it involves interacting with your partner. Games can inject fun into a stale evening, so rather than individually scrolling through Facebook, switch the social channel off for some interaction with your best buddy - your partner. Competition stirs up many emotions, but keep it on the light side and it will evoke just the right ones to enjoy a playful evening with your partner.

**Laugh together** - did you know that women laugh 126% more than men, guys you must be pretty funny right? Well keep each other laughing, as laughing truly makes us happier. It releases those 'feel good' endorphins, lowers stress and can even better our health. Not a comedian? That's ok there's tons of ways to get the giggles on.  Try reminiscing over past events you both cracked-up at, look through some funny old photos, play a (nice) prank or if all else fails  have a tickle fight.
